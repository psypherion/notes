# My understanding of reality

  

My first claim :
1. Everything is governed by physical laws more in a constraint manner. 

2. Rest reality is emergence of these constraints
->
A system has inertia(. All systems have. Each and every manifestation of nature be it me, u any human being any living being any non living being. Hence all are constrained and governed by physical laws.)

and to explore this idea better in more understandable way from a biological perspective it can be viewed as homeostasis or allostasis.
Our body as a whole (I’m not differentiating body mind or other meta physical thing like soul) is a system. Which can be interpreted by various approaches. 
Be it quantum aspect, classical physical aspect, biological aspect etc. now every interpretation signifies the system. And a system must have inertia. The reason of inertia being maintaining stability against entropy. 

So our system too has inertia. 
Now this physical aspect can be interpreted in philosophical term as will to exist.
Let me explain, If you’re aware of re enforcement learning you are well aware of the loss function and how it governs the learning process as a whole. 

So, when people got a bit civilized they were no longer was just an predator. He was more than just his animal instincts. A complex social being. Not just in human, this can bee seen too in some other animals with range of differences.

The earliest form of any human relationship is parents if grand parents exist they too as at that time there weren’t atomic families. After death, to find solution for problems mostly related to survival issues human started worshipping their dead closed ones. 

But one must ask why?

This is simple. And I will come to this later.

Whenever any natural calamities happened, those became threats for their survival. 
Nature never cared for anyone. 
These natural threats has to be understood and somehow people needed to find solutions. 
And as at that time science wasn’t formed properly, people humanized this forces as started worshipping them as deitys to survive. 
But why?

  

Now lets explore and find the answer.

  

As we all are systems. We have the inertia hence the threats were nothing but sources of entropy. And a system by physical constraints tries to preserve its stability against entropy. 

  

Hence the will to exist against the threats against the entropy.

  

This is the very basic emergence of complex societal assumptions.

  

Now with time societal structures got more and more complex. The more we found threats to ourselves or our communities we started finding better solutions. Thus rituals, mantras, hymns, gods formed. 

  

I’m being too simple knowingly. 

  

Lets break a few major religion and lets find common themes. 

  

But first I must convey my one single belief that I hold the term “Hinduism” never appeared in any early stage of our culture’s theistic scriptures. And these terms is given by much later by those who invaded our country. So even when I say hinduism I’m not talking about a religion. Because even though vedas are seen somehow is a scripture for hindus logically that made no sense. 

  

When I was a kid, I always was fascinated with theistic scriptures no matter how much I loved science. And my peers of different religions, I was eager to learn their theistic scriptures be it Quoran, bible etc. (Given where I grew up I only could access peers of these two religions) 

  

I grew up seeing the so called problems between hindu and muslims. I never saw someone as different from me. Someone’s appearance cant define who they are nor their beliefs. We are all flesh and blood. Brothers and sisters. So in a way it always bothered me whenever anyone tried to differentiate people based on religion. Didn’t made sense. Still doesn’t make any sense. In most “hindu” households we weren’t taught on vedas upanishads or vedanta philosophy not evn geeta. Whereas I could see other religious practices where it was common for people to actually read them from an early age. 

  

I liked that at the same time hated it as well. 

Young minds should never be taught to differentiate themselves from others. And in a way reading different doctrines at early age makes a person vulnerable to option of differentiation. Because at early age our brains’ plasticity is high and hence more susceptible to any new information….

  

Why one should read theistic scriptures not at the early age nor at the late age?

  

To be an athiest you need to know there is no god 

not that you believe there is no god. Any believe system rises same issues more or less. And also to be an theistic person you need to know there exists a god not i believe there exists a god. 

  

Belief system mustn’t be passed down or instilled rather one must actively choose one if they need/want. 

  

So, to be an athiest or a thiest you need to understand science theology philosophy.

  

Many people have misconceptions reading science alone makes you smarter makes you an atheist. Let me tell you that is not the case. 

  

I have seen people with high science background cant even apply even the intuition behind equation in his own life. Where as a person who has not any such rigorous scientific background can even apply intuitively apply the same idea.

  

Beliefs are formed at vulnerable points in our lives. When we are kids our brain is easily adaptable to new information. So it is easier for a belief system to hijack our mind. 

  

When we face tremendous loss or fear , as a vulnerable stage belief systems can hijack too.

  

Purpose of a belief system is nothing but a easy way out in the absurdity and uncertainty. 

  

Thats why in any religion where a kid is brought up with hard and fast belief system often tends to be more aggressive and less compassionate against other views. But that is not always the case. As we grow up people evolve so does our brain. So even after growing up in a less compassionate or highly conservative religious family a person can outgrow such morals if 

1. They feel trapped in that system and hence might feel the urge to overcome that.
2. With knowledge and more and more understanding and experience without holding on to a steadfast beliefs.

  

  

You can see every fascist empire be it nazi be it stalin they all dotrinated mass by schools and media. 

  

The exact same thing happens when you force a child to read a scripture.

  

Not just force. Even if the kid sees you reading a single scripture it strikes them as something unique and a source of maybe connection and thus rest can flow. 

  

  

Religion could have been the very best resource to fight against capitalism, materialism yet the way religion is experienced sowed the seeds of capitalism

  

But one mustn’t just live in this what ifs?

  

He must dig deeper and ask why religion descended to more corruptive structure. 

  

  

Science wasn’t advanced back then. So it wasnt really available for masses to understand their own biology. 

  

We are made of flesh and blood. Ask yourself why it feels hard to stop scrolling, eating junk food or even consuming porn and why even men act like sex addicts

  

Hormones. There are other reasons too from societal, psychological but most general and easily influential is hormones. It dictates our body and rest follows. 

  

Even though religion teaches us transcendence greater than self values it all gets corrupted cause it doesn’t provide any framework for how this bodily natural function can and will affect. Hence slowly even if someone teacher us to be compassionate to others to not hoard money to not betray over th generations when the importance of the words slowly dissipates because of less threatening time it is our bodily function that dictates us not the actual belief systems.

  

And hence this mixture gets corrupted .

  

And If people were to read doctrines to understand “god” or some cosmic code/guidelines, they must go through more than one. 

  

I never asked which was right. To me if there’s a single entity who created all then he must created the other religions too. So that must be different aspect of that entity. 

  

Where most my peers were in a way okay with this super omnipotent omnipresent entity, I wasn’t. I saw nature as the ultimate manifestation of reality. Even though I was taught nature being nourishing and sympathy like character hence calling mother nature. I always viewed nature as something who didn’t give a shit about anything. The only truth it carries is change. 

  

The only everlasting truth is change. And that is a must to keep the universe exist. Otherwise it cant even collapse on itself. Without any change photon’s mustn’t travel space time curve. Everything becomes stagnant. 

  

So natures symbolized the change the only truth to me.

  

  

  

Now lets shift our focus a bit towards modern science specifically neuroscience.

  

Our brain stores memory in two different ways.

  

1. Episodic
2. Semantic

  

Episodic memory is the awake state when people interact with society act on something survive etc etc. 

  

And semantic memory is built by the early neuron pathway structures created due to genetic configuration which later is trained on by highlighted memories from episodic memory. 

  

Thus, semantic memory served as a global contextual memory and episodic memory became in a way local contextual memory.

  

Now if we explore neuroscience a bit more we can find brain’s free energy principle. Where it states most day to day works the reptative tasks doesn’t require thinking its free of cost almost.

  

Due to this, two psychological versions of self is created but mostly in a subtle ways. One is for daily stuff due to free energy principle how we mostly interact with society all that is because of free energy principle our brain doesn’t like to think or waste enegy. This perspective can be seen as I often classify it as “actor” the persona we present for society an day to day use. And the other one being learned through lessons and realisations. That persona I named it “observer”. The one who watches all.

  

Now people often cant experience the observer persona properly but it’s thinking leaks through the cracks in dreams in societal interactions when even though the way one interacts is justified but still it doesn’t feel like themselves that is the observer persona. 

  

  

Now lets jump back to early ages…

People without any knowledge of how brain works how psychology works this observer persona no longer can be explained someone from inside us (even when people claimed god is inside us by naming it as a third entity we outsource the persona which is infact flawed).

  

Hence the voice of observer became the brahmana the pure consciousness advaita vedanta talked about, when hazarat md was visioned he wasn’t visioned by god he was visioned by himself, so was siddhartha’s codes so was christ. 

  

The outsourced meaning become the sole reason the poisonous reason once that hold each community together is the same reason why people fight over religion. Even though it came from a single almost same thing as people endure different society across different continents their observer’s perspective too differed. Hence the god differed. So the belief system and so the wars reigned. And who ever picked up fight in the name of god to oppress to get revenge they couldn’t astray further from god themselves.

  

Now one might ask why a few chosen people were able to get the vision. If my theory is correct then the sense of god lies in everyone then why didn’t they all experienced god the same way atleast in a apeticular region. Why a few people only were visioned!

  

In psychology, we find two types of post trauma situations. 

  

1. PTSD
2. PTG

  

On facing great trauma like in vedic time period even before that at the early stages before aryans came harappa mahenjodaro civilization was already at the brink of destruction due to natural calamities. Hence the urban civilization broke into pieces. When aryans came slowly as they got used to this environment thy faced the same issues as others too. Famine, natural calamities etc.

  

If we trace out societal issues regarding each prophetic characters we find similar situations…

  

Watching death can be a highest form of trauma. Because it signifies, the collapse of the system. The uncertainty of our lives i.e our systems hence the same issue rose. The same reason why people started worshipping dead relatives or natural forces.

  

Now if you are well versed in bit of psychology you’ll know statistical distribution of people post trauma. 

  

Most people conforms to either ptsd or they weren’t bothered by it that much while trying to get back to their base version.

  

But very few experiences growth after trauma. 

  

But this growth too is just another manifestation of our will to exist but in different form. 

  

We are but predators. And we are to distinguish between food and danger.

  

Now, lets say like a reinforcement learning model on a certain epoch you evaluated a,b,c to be threats and e,f,g,h to be non threatening.

  

But models are not perfect by birth. Hence lets say e and f was too threats which the model couldn’t realized that being the threat. 

  

Now if the trauma is traumatic enough for a person, our loss function itself changes. Hence, where we were to find patterns to differentiate between threat and food we also started finding patterns that is similar in each category. So only through finding the similarities one could find the e and f to be the threats too. So no longer the model finds the differentiation factors rather similarity factors. 

  

The same thing happened to siddhartha, Vivekananda, Hazarat md. , christ. Each and everyone. 

  

Faced trauma, rose above trauma and deliver a solution. Removing the divine non natural bs. 

  

  

After a phase of ptsd one could follow ascetic ideals an try to go through the stages that follow but there is a better way which I accidentally found and that is “bhakti” / “agape” 

  

Now with bit time, self reflection, introspection they all achieved a sense of enlightenment to some extent. But it wasn’t enlightenment as something divine rather a coping mechanism in an absurd world to see patterns in hreats before thy could harm. Hence making solutions were easy and as it wasn’t for differentiating it seemed like a force of good, divine etc. 

  

They preached their findings like gospels without actually realizing the main source wasnt the divine consciousness or god or some rulebook but the trauma. 

  

So did everyone who followed them. Its easy for people to outsource rather than building something or taking responsibilities as their own and that is the reason why most people seek their parents’ comfort god’s comfort as someone above them who could guide them through pain/threats. 

  

The observer’s voice is silenced and replaced by temporary earthly connections, parents too are fleeting connections. 

  

Now one might ask: “okay! Like the problem why the so called enlightened ones created the religion or codes to live by if the problem was solved then still at this day why it is relevant?”

  

See, with the absence of realisation of observer within themselves the moral views relied solely on traditions and god. Two thinga happened one those who was troubled enough in those traumatic situation and over the years as more complex societal structure grew when the threat was removed we needed some place to belong to. Somewhere where we could be accepted as ourselves even if we cant follow the exact words the prophets preached or traditions hold. 

  

And that is will to belong. This too is an manifestation of will to exist.

  

A safe space away from the chaos, threats. A place of pure acceptance. And religion become an easy solution for that too. Later consumerism capitalism also served the same purpose. Thats why we could see even in a family if a kid strays from the beliefs from the parents they wouldn’t hesitate to ostracise. (But not all parents tho).

  

People could shed the blood of their own brothers in the name of religion, because sharing similar views gives that much sene of belonging that even one’s own blood cannot provide that sense.

  

  

Hence religions reigned so did capitalism and consumerism.

  

Now one might interrupt : “Few religions opposes exactly against capitalistic views like Islam

Then why I said the source is the same from all?”

  

See, even those religions who opposed the capitalistic views as it was created and nourished with the same logic. capitalism was just times away from happening. Thats the reason any religion no matter how they oppose capitalistic views by design they promote it unknowingly. 

  

  

Nietzsche promoted the idea of will to power to be the driving will and Vivekananda claimed will to transcend sense is the ultimate. They both were right in their own way but they both were wrong too.

  

They are just different manifestations of will to exist that is our system’s inertia too.

discussions:

  

  

Argument : coordination, information transmission, moral scaffolding, and identity technology.

  

 Response : these are the exact things that signifies the will to belong amongst society

  

  

Argument : it explains the origin of meaning and moral systems, not necessarily their normative worth. Ethics still needs normative argumentation; this theory supplies genealogy, not prescriptions.

  

Response : If the genealogy itself shows the problems why the religion started then the solutions they provide becomes not that significant here. Because at this day and age even with these advanced technologies scientific background people will still cling to their beliefs like they define them and could even go aginst other and wars are becoming common day by day because within the creation of religion lied the problematic situations hence the solutions even though they were valid at that society didn’t hold any proper value now. Even though people’s will to belong is satisfied so is war going on.

  

Now should one be selfish enough to think ok i am feeling happy and accepted thats why it doesn’t matter that this is the exact same reason war is going one corruption is going on

  

  

Treat “will to exist” as emergent effective behavior produced by dynamics that minimize surprise/entropy.

  

Historical complexity: Religious origins are heterogeneous; some rituals predate certain environmental shocks. Predictions must be probabilistic, not deterministic.

  

In the tribal aspect of religion worshipping dead relatives there rituals formed too

  

And so does woshipping natural forces there were rituals too but wasnt any religion as such

  

In advaita vedanta They anticipate this internal external split and that is why they are far more advanced than any other religion ever was. But

  

They differentiate just that. 

  

They all promote neti neti self negation. 

  

Making the observer is the ultimate of sort and later advaita vedanta introduces brahman ultimate consciousness which too is just bs 

  

One mustn’t seek the belonging in outward rather inwardly when the observer accepts the actor they synthesise and become one 

  

No longer there is the psychological need of will to belong

  

  

The key solution of how one can experience god 

  

Is accepting both of one selves maybe even multiple more the merrier. Krishna held 108 names describing each of his aspects and possible different traits. (Given I view krishna as a character/concept not someone in flesh and blood). The only proof of peophets that exists is of : siddhartha and mohammed. So except them we need to consider the rest as characters might be built of some form of truth like christ being defined as the prophet long after his death and only when there were none to establish the temple of yahweh.

  

So the key is not just neti neti but also iti iti

  

Not just I am not this nor that but also I am this also that.

  

With self integrity it will flow naturally that no humans are different from the other rather just a play of moderation. And with that sense a higher sense of unity comes. Which is not just so called “spiritual” integrity rather actual real understanding of people. Hence no more one would fight wage war against other rather all will help other as a universal community. For self for others.

  

The misuse of the word maya has bothered me too. Usually people when faced with something unexpected or unwanted people claim as such that the thing being delusional. And use the phrase everything is maya. But according to vedantic gita through krishna’s ideologies we find him wecannot break free the chains if we are not even properly tied to.

  

Which I realized as such to be disillu

  

How to live a life a better way according to my philosophical views:

  

**Micro Anchors**

  

  

**1. Break the Pattern (Disruption Therapy)**

  

**Do:** Intentionally subvert your routine once a week. Take a different street. Skip your morning anchor. Sabotage the sequence.

**Why:** Comfort calcifies into prison. Conscious disruption reminds the brain it still has agency—before someone else scripts it for you.

  

⸻

  

**2. Sugar Communion (Neurochemical Forgiveness)**

  

**Do:** Offer your body the sacrament of sweetness—chocolate, soda, something gloriously trashy.

**Why:** Not all salvation is spiritual. Sometimes serotonin comes wrapped in foil. Let it. Then move.

  

⸻

  

**3. Embrace the Monotony (Communal Trance)**

  

**Do:** Fully immerse in a mundane, shared task—waiting in line, riding a bus, folding laundry.

**Why:** There’s strange peace in synchronized mediocrity. You don’t always have to resist. Just exist.

  

⸻

  

**4. Tangible Echo (Visible Existence)**

  

**Do:** Finish something that leaves a mark—a cleaned floor, a fixed bug, a drawn face. Bonus points if someone else sees it.

**Why:** Your existence shouldn’t vanish by nightfall. Let the day whisper back: _you were here._

  

⸻

  

**5. Morning Drift (Silent Descent)**

  

**Do:** Upon waking, sit. Not to meditate, not to plan. Just to **be**.

**Why:** Reality hits like a fist. Give yourself a moment before it lands.

  

⸻

  

**6. Uncensored Dispatch (Mental Purge)**

  

**Do:** Spill a thought. Onto paper. Into voice memos. Raw, unfiltered. No poetry required.

**Why:** Bottled thoughts breed rot. Rot grows noise. Spit it out.

  

⸻

  

**7. Vagabond Interruption (Spatial Rebellion)**

  

**Do:** Once a week, become lost on purpose. Roam where you don’t belong.

**Why:** Patterns collapse when space shifts. New places, even ugly ones, resurrect awareness.

  

⸻

  

**8. Obsession Hour (Sacred Fire)**

  

**Do:** Protect a block of time for your unmarketable love—physics, sketching, cryptic code, whatever still haunts you.

**Why:** Let no system claim your soul. Your obsession is proof you’re not dead inside.

  

⸻

  

**9. Elemental Contact (Primitive Recalibration)**

  

**Do:** Touch the outside world—sun on skin, wind in teeth, dirt under nails.

**Why:** You’re not a machine. Reunite with the ancient. Your skin remembers.

  

⸻

  

**10. Creative Insurgence (Imperfect Godhood)**

  

**Do:** Make something. Anything. It doesn’t have to be good. Just honest.

**Why:** Creation is rebellion. A message from the void: _I still shape things._

  

⸻

  

**11. Sacred Solitude (Noise Withdrawal)**

  

**Do:** Retreat. Guiltlessly. No input. No output. Just silence and self.

**Why:** Performance poisons identity. Solitude purifies it. Let no one witness you for a while.

  

⸻

  

**12. Labor Offering (Body as Proof)**

  

**Do:** Engage in physical work—carry, clean, fix, move. Not for achievement, but exertion.

**Why:** The mind can lie. The body can’t. This is sweat as scripture.

  

⸻

  

**13. The Pulse Release (Chemical Honesty)**

  

**Do:** Masturbate or have sex—not to escape, not to impress—but to release.

**Why:** Sexual tension distorts perception. Release is clarity. No guilt, no mysticism. Just nerve and breath and reset
