Results from the *dharma* (virtuous path) consisting on steady adherence to knowledge of the self, preceeded by renunciation of all rites, duties. This is the main purpot of *Gita*. As said by Krishna himself the in the *Anugita* : "That Very Virtuous path is quite adequate for the realization of the state of Brahman."

It also been said that :
- *One who is neither a follower of virtue nor of vice* and indeed not even engaged in good and bad;
- *He who remains absorbed in the same posture, silent, and without thinking of anything*

Hence wishing to impart that *knowledge of the self*  Vasudeva making Arjuna the medium and goes on ranting xd...

***Bodhayana*** : 

Liberation cannot be attained merely from continuance in the knowledge of the self which is preceeded by renunciation of all duties and is independent of any other factor. 

The Liberation is attained through knowledge associated with rites and duties. 

Even this objection should not be raised that Vedic rites and duties lead to sin since they involve injury and ...

***Shankaracarya*** :
Assertion if distinction between  firm adherence to knowledge and to action which are based ikn. two convictions. 
Even considering your own duty is *sankhya*.
*Sankhya Buddhi* is the conviction with regard to supreme reality arising from the ascertainment of the meaning of the context-that the self is not an agent because of the absence in it of the six kinds of changes : 
1. Birth
2. Continuance
3. Growth
4. Transformation
5. Decay
6. Death
*Sankhyas* are those men of knowledge to whom conviction becomes natural.
