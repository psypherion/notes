# Home

is where the heart is.
Mine?

In my chest,
Behind my ribs
Surrounded with veins
That keeps me running.

But,
It beats off-key.
in minor keys.
Syncopated grief.
Out of time. Out of line.
Too raw for that kitchen table small talk,
too loud for a mother —
who equated stillness with goodness.

She made tea when I sobbed.
As if heat could cure the aching.
As if silence, and a warm cup,
could replace years of not listening.

Not because she lacked love — but because her love had conditions.
Be quiet.
Be normal.

Be the boy who didn’t ask questions—

She loved the version of me she imagined —
one who didn’t feel so much, 
think so much, _fight_ so much.
But I did. I still do.

I didn’t grow up.
I adapted.
Like a stray animal in a house 
too clean for emotion, too rigid for chaos.
I learned—
how to mimic affection, nod through disappointment,
shut my mouth before I speak that made her cry.

Home was never safe.
It was just _quiet_.
A quiet that hummed with judgments unspoken,
with shame—
duct-taped over emotion.

And so I built my own.
I rebelled.
Not to be better—
No.

Just to survive—
Death.
