# Nails
I crave her nails.
digging deep into my skin—
To mark me.
A flesh aching to be read—
gets
Written with sharpness 
And want.

Only in that ache, 
Do I exist.
An ache I want to bottle,
Savour, 
Bleed with.
Thats when
She loosens.

I have to pretend 
Not to like it.
But I do.
God, I do.

In that split second
I notice her—
What she hides.
A calm chaos,
Coiled quiet
Waiting to be found
Yet, terrified of being seen.

That’s her.
And
I ache to see her,
I want to know her.
No,
I _need_ to.
