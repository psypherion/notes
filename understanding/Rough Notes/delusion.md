# delusion


To love is not to suffer.

To love is to be delusional.

To love is not seeing the suffering.

To love is to commit to not seeing the sufferings.

To love is to see beyond suffering.

To love is to be delusional enough to accept the sufferings.

To love is to chose again and again.

To love is to kneel.

To love is to will.

Will to be wrong.
