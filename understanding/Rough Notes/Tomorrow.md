# Tomorrow

‘t wasn’t the rain that soaked me.
It was _her_.
She engrossed me.

I could see her—
the one she stitched behind her eyes,
now out,
Like a wildflower 
On a wall.

I saw her.

My hands, 
traitors,
ached to reach—
her,
for the ache beneath her ribs.
The tremble behind her jaw.

But I didn’t.
Not out of virtue.
Out of reverence.

To hold her now
would be to—
end the moment.
To trap the clawed beast
in language.
In closure.
And I—
I live in unfinished sentences.

So I mourned.
Like an abandoned sonnet
A pause too long.
A line half-said.

And whispered 
with ache—
_Tomorrow._
Let me hold her
tomorrow.
