# Until

I see people

for who they are.

I understand,

More than they could ever understand—

Themselves.

  

It’s a misery—

Packed with narcissism.

I digress.

A gift.

For you

Me 

Him.

  

It comes,

With a price.

Too hefty.

To not be understood.

To not be held—

With the greatest of affection.

  

I paid—

With all 

My sweat and bones.

Until

I got too brittle.

  

  

I fill up my lungs

With smokes

Of burning 

men,

I cough.

I—

inhale.

_I._
