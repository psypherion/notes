# Love - As I see it

What is love? — I’ve spent (at least for me) quite a long time to finally get a grasp of the whole thing. 

What I will say here is completely from my perspective and experience one’s approach may differ. But I think my approach is general enough to describe, sustain love.

Love is an illusion. To love someone is to how well you can keep the illusion running. The efforts you do to sustain the illusion that, that defines your love.

  

Love is “a” illusion, solution to fight life’s absurdity. Like religion, drug, suicide etc.

But unlike others it could be blissful, with a bit of suffering perhaps. But that’s the beauty. The suffering brings the meaning, the beauty.

  

First thing we need to clear is we, whole human civilisation has one single will — will to belong. This is my claim.

Sustainability with respect to one’s self and their society around them.

To know it’s all fake and illusion yet you still put efforts to please the other one, that’s what love is. 

Love is a act of pleasing. 

Pleasing is done by satisfying needs and wants of the partner.

  

A proper balance means a better compatible relationship. Some needs and some wants maybe contrastingly different in comparison with each other. 

So a proper balance is to be maintained.
