# When to read scriptures?

Why one should read theistic scriptures not at the early age nor at the late age

To be an athiest you need to know there is no god not that you believe there is no god. Any believe system rises same issues more or less. And also to be an theistic person you need to know there exists a god not i believe there exists a god. 

Belief system mustn’t be passed down or instilled rather one must actively choose one if they need/want. 

So, to be an athiest or a thiest you need to understand science theology philosophy.

Many people have misconceptions reading science alone makes you smarter makes you an atheist. Let me tell you that is not the case. 

I have seen people with high science background cant even apply even the intuition behind equation in his own life. Where as a person who has not any such rigorous scientific background cant even apply intuitively apply this simple thing. 

Beliefs are formed at vulnerable points in our lives. When we are kids our brain is easily adaptable to new information. So it is easier for a belief system to hijack our mind. 

When we face tremendous loss or fear , as a vulnerable stage belief systems can hijack too.

Purpose of a belief system is nothing but a easy way out in the absurdity and uncertainty. 

Thats why in any religion where a kid is brought up with hard and fast belief system often tends to be more aggressive and less compassionate against other religious views. But that is not always the case. As we grow up people evolve so does our brain. So even after growing up in a less compassionate or highly conservative religious family a person can outgrow such morals if 

1. They feel trapped in that system and hence might feel the urge to overcome that.
2. With knowledge and more and more understanding and experience without holding on ti steadfast beliefs.

You can see every fascist empire be it nazi be it stalin they all doctrinated mass by schools and media. 

The exact same thing happens when you force a child to read a scripture.

Not just force. Even if the kid sees you reading a single scripture it strikes them as something unique and a source of maybe connection and thus rest can flow. 

Religion could have been the very best resource to fight against capitalism yet the way religion is experienced sowed the seeds of capitalism

But one mustn’t just live in this what ifs?

He must dig deeper and ask why religion descended to more corruptive structure. 

Science wasn’t advanced back then. So it wasnt really available for masses to understand their own biology. 

We are made of flesh and blood. Ask yourself why it feels hard to stop scrolling, eating junk food or even consuming porn and why even men act like “chutpaglu”

Hormones. There are other reasons too from societal, psychological but most general and easily influential is hormones. It dictates our body and rest follows. 

Even though religion teaches us transcendence greater than self values it all gets corrupted cause it doesn’t provide any framework for how this bodily natural function can and will affect. Hence slowly even if someone teacher us to be compassionate to others to not hoard money to not betray over th generations when the importance of the words slowly dissipates because of less threatening time it is our bodily function that dictates us not the actual belief systems.

And hence this mixture gets corrupted .
