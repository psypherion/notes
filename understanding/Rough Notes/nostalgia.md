Today, I felt I’ll miss this place. I’ll miss everything. All the things I hated, all the things I loved. How I learned and unlearned all the things. How I felt romanticism again. How we all bonded, crashed every bit. I cherish all the moments now. 

  

This, An eventful chapter.

The unpredicted light on 4th floor’s gym which stays closed all the time, I dont know made me feel something in my nerves. How I started predicting this, this place. I have created it in my brain. Now I’m attached forever. Stitched to it’s every fabric, no matter how thin will it be.
