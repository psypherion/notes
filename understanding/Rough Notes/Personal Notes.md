I’ve felt it again. In my dysfunctional nerve, it’s there. I forgot how beautiful it is to yearn for someone. And maybe that’s why I’m terrified of it. 

Do I deserve yearning?

How can someone so emotionally anaesthetized even have the right to love someone, to yearn for someone? 

I rest my case: I am a narcissist, unstable, undeserving by choice. Therefore, I shouldn’t.

[Date]

Freedom is paralysis. And I may be, am paralyzed.

Last night, I forgot to bring dinner. And had to go into one of my juniors’ rooms. He opened his almirah. A shelf full of choices – hope. I stood still for a couple of minutes. I laughed at my own inability – to choose. I was high though. 

At that moment, I knew—I’d always wanted freedom. More than anything. Yet, high in the middle of the night, the God of vain attempts struck me. He punched me in the guts a little too hard before I could even scream. So, I laughed. 

I am but paralyzed.

[Date]

I woke up. I smoked throughout the whole day. I was watching a video of a guy sharing his drug experience and he shared : “Drugs have made him dull.”

Why is it not doing that to me??

Why do I keep thinking – everything. Why can’t I be dull for just a second! 

He must be laughing at my misery. For him I have a phallic symbol, to tell him to just shut the fuck up. 

That’s me. God’s glaring phallic symbol. One day it hopes not to exist just like him.

[Date]

We met. We talked. 

She dug her nails deep into my arms. I felt seen. For the very first time. I felt I was being read. I caught a glimpse of her too. Not just her. The one with clawed nails that reaches down to your soul and holds a mirror. 

I could’ve just existed between them, what was it? Was it painful? – I can’t recall. All I could remember is : Bliss.

I didn’t know how to react.

Is it the most romantic thing anyone has ever done to me?

[Date]

I collected quotes from Pinterest and listened to the same ten songs on repeat. I couldn’t see her today. Everything is so bland, plain, boring. 

Dear Camus,

          I don’t know how Sisyphus could be happy. All I could see here is a society engrossed in capitalism. And that is what makes us rot from the inside. 

          Now tell me, how would a modern-day Sisyphus work? I can’t accept the nuisance. This is destroying society. From packaged food to “holy temple”, he took a leave. 

          Should I too?

[Date]

I saw her. 

If we were linguistic symbols, she could’ve been the exclamation mark !

And I would be too busy at the end –with a question. 

[Date]

She wants to be persuaded, to be swayed, to be lifted from the ground. One might consider her a hopeless romantic. But I digress. She is hopeful. The hopelessness lies in me. For me, hope was the hindrance, a lack of evidence to claim something true. There is my hope. In a house on a cliff –after an earthquake. Her eyes shine bright with hope, but I could sense something else.

There’s something, she harbours something, someone deep in her. She keeps her safe, locked away from the world. But I saw her. Within the light and night, between two lamp posts and stolen glances, I saw her. She wants to be seen. It’s her. 

She fears to let her out. 

Tragedy!

A great one.

[Date]

If only she could read every letter the way I write about her.

I gave her my writings — my half-formed manuscripts, my unfinished metaphors, my poems—all about her, of course. 

Has she understood them?

Has she read the ache between the pauses? 

The way I breathe her into every margin?

She must have.

See — hope.

My old addiction. My new audacity.

God, I’m still writing her into sentences I pretend are about me. I become such a hopeless fool when I yearn.

To yearn for someone like a miserable poet. That’s what I write for. To get her,  I write. To feel her breath, I write. To feel her legs resting on mine, I write. 

[Date]

Today I explained to one of my friends how I can’t feel sad or usual emotions people feel when they are told about someone being dead.

Let me explain. Feeling emotions and understanding myself didn’t come naturally to me. Rather, I watched people, tv shows, and read books to understand the characters and, in a way, to understand myself. For me, serial killing series offer more insights into a man’s personal journey than the rest. 

Over the years, I almost mimicked every emotion when to feel which one, both logically and emotionally. But for death, I don’t know how to react.

Death never bothered me that much. I know the grief the loved ones feel, but still, I couldn’t relate to that grief. Hence, I mostly stay indifferent.

Or else, I laugh. I joke about death.

I remember one particular moment. It was evening, and as usual, I was there at my students’ place . I was mostly a chilled teacher, never pressurising them that much. I don’t know why, but she mentioned that her grandma got cancer and it was in the last stage or something.

I burst out laughing. She knew I would laugh. There was another student who was relatively new. She was confused.

[Date]

My yearnings have turned into something more primal. No longer am I satisfied being written by her. I want to write her too. I want to claw her too. I want to write. Not just with ink and paper , with nails and teeth too.

Is it lust? I shouldn’t.

[Date]

Today, I felt I’ll miss this place. I’ll miss everything. All the things I hated, all the things I loved. How I learned and unlearned all the things. How I met her. How I felt romanticism again. How we all bonded, crashed every bit. I cherish all the moments now. 

This, an eventful chapter.

Saturday, 31st May, 2025

[1:55 a.m.]

The unpredictable light on the 4th floor’s gym, which stays closed all the time, I don’t know, made me feel something in my nerves. How I started predicting this, this place. I have created it in my brain. Now I’m attached forever. Stitched to its every fabric, no matter how thin it will be.

Farewell.

Ours, apparently.

I was backstage—half-tuned guitar in hand, full-body ache on standby. Waiting for my bit. Pretending it mattered.

And then they went on. The juniors. A group performance. You could call it a song if you’re generous. More like a crows with mic access. Shrill, stretched voices. 

I stood there, behind the curtain—each off-key note punched me in the guts. And I swear, for a second—I imagined walking out mid-performance, smiling, and smashing my guitar against their heads, blood spurting all over my face. The red tinge, it’s soothing, it’s warm. Like a home should be.

But I didn’t.

[Date]

Today I tried explaining to a friend why I don’t feel sad—or anything, really—when someone tells me someone’s dead.

Let me be clear: emotions never came naturally to me. I had to learn them. Watched people. Studied their faces. Read characters like manuals. TV shows helped. So did books. Mostly, I mimicked. Rehearsed grief. Performed joy. Assigned the right expressions to the right triggers.

Strangely, it was never the usual dramas that taught me what I am. It was the shows about serial killers. The spirals of disturbed men. The long, slow descent of the ones too aware. That’s where I recognized myself—more than in therapy, school, or love. Their breakdowns made more sense than any motivational monologue ever did.

But death?

I never figured that one out.

I understand it, sure. I know what’s expected. I know the logic of loss, the weight people carry. But I don’t feel it. Not really. So I do what I do best—default to indifference. Or worse—

I laugh.

And not some polite, awkward chuckle. Full-blown laughter.

I don’t know why. It’s like my body short-circuits. Some people cry. I glitch.

I remember this one evening, I was at my student’s house. Usual session. Chill as always. No pressure. Out of nowhere, she says—calmly, like she was reading weather—

“Dada, my thamma has cancer. Final stage, probably.”

And I burst out laughing.

She didn’t even blink. She knew I would.

That was the fucked-up part.

The other student—a newer one—just sat there confused. The poor girl didn’t know the syllabus came with this kind of absurdity.

But that’s the thing. My laugh wasn’t denial. It wasn’t joy. It wasn’t even a rebellion.

It was muscle memory.

I think I laughed because it’s the one response no one rehearses for.

[Date]

I caved.

I took photos.

Videos, too.

Plenty.

Not candid. Not careful.

Just… real.

Her mid-sentence.

Smiling with a mouth half full.

Laughing at something I didn’t find funny — but now I think I do.

I told myself it was for art. For memory.

But it was neither.

It was panic.

Something in me knew she was slipping.

Not from me — not yet — but from the idea of her I’d archived too cleanly.

[Date]

I’ve started noticing things again.

Noticing — not analysing.

The way her hair falls into her eyes.

The smell of dust when she’s around.

The way she bites her food like it’s a ritual.

I used to call this distraction.

I used to call this illusion.

Now I call it… data.

Emotional data.

I collect it to prove to myself that something happened here.

That I was, for a while, more than noise in the background.

Absurd, isn’t it?

I write about her like I’m archiving a dying star.

[Date]

She sent an image. I saved it. 

I was on our campus ground when I opened it. The breeze was soft, forgiving—like the kind of wind that knows you’ve been carrying too much.

A few moments earlier, I’d seen her. She asked me to wait.

I did.

She came.

She was wearing a blue shirt—slightly oversized. It suited her. She looked like something I couldn’t name, but knew I liked. I couldn’t see her face—she wore a mask.

Maybe it’s better that way.

No. Not really.

I wanted to see her face. No arguing there.

Lately, I’ve been letting my guard down. Just a little. Enough to be dangerous.

I sent her a text.

She replied with a photo—her face this time.

Then another.

This woman, my dear readers,  she’s doing things to me.

I’m feeling again. The hopelessness. The messiness. The awkwardness. The aching silences. The goddamned yearning.

And I’m archiving again. Every sentence. Every moment. Every version of her.

I’m doing it all over again.

[Date]

How does one choose anything?

I don’t think we even possess any ounce of that capacity. Beware, I don’t believe in destiny, either. No divine scripts. No lines etched in the palm of your sweaty, trembling hand.

But I do believe in structures.

We are shaped — hemmed in — by conditions: economic, historical, neural, social. By the limits of our perception, by the damage our childhoods did to our sense of possibility.

So no, we don’t choose. Not really.

We move, and are moved, like an object rolling down a slope someone else built.

Every “decision” is just an intersection of constraints.

We interact. The system responds. The illusion of agency is preserved.

We are actors without improvisation rights.

A shameful life, indeed.

[Date]

Nietzsche hated neural suppressors. Drugs. Alcohol. Anything that dulled the nerve. He saw them as cowardice.

So did I. I never touched them. Not once. Didn’t need to — I had will, reason, clarity.

Funny thing: I take them now. For the same reason. And yet — they don’t do what he feared.

They don’t make me dumb. They don’t make me numb. They just let me float.

I still overthink. Still spiral.

Still decide against my better judgment, like a loyal masochist.

They don’t stop me. They just… quiet the room.

Like noise cancellation headphones for a brain wired to pick up every single frequency.

It’s not a high. It’s a hum. A dull grace. Maybe that’s worse.

[Date]

Tomorrow

‘T wasn’t the rain that soaked me.

It was her.

She engrossed me.

I could see her—

the one she stitched behind her eyes,

now out,

Like a wildflower

On a wall.

I saw her.

My hands,

traitors,

ached to reach—

her,

for the ache beneath her ribs.

The tremble behind her jaw.

But I didn’t.

Not out of virtue.

Out of reverence.

To hold her now

would be to—

end the moment.

To trap the clawed beast

in language.

In closure.

And I—

I live in unfinished sentences.

So I mourned.

Like an abandoned sonnet.

A pause too long.

A line half-said.

And whispered

with ache—

Tomorrow.

Let me hold her

tomorrow.

[Soaked skin. Her voice. Her fingers—how they gathered raindrops just to flick them across my face. I felt knighted. Maybe that’s how they felt, too. I didn’t know how to respond. So I mimicked—flicked water back, gently. But it wasn’t the same. Not even close. I wanted her to flick again. Harder. Again. Would she ever know me? Truly? Would she ever understand that the things she holds back—those are the ones I crave the most?]

[Date]

How to feel emotions? Do you know this? Anyone in the audience, do they know it? Answer me ‘cause I simply don’t. At least I didn’t. I was far too lazy to look it up, but hey, you’re reading this, and I’m still high watching you suffer reading an abomination of a journal.

Drum rolls!!!

Intellectualization till the brink of despair. 

  

[Date]

Oh, Hortensia! To earn someone’s love.

[Date]

Lately, I’ve been trying to socialize. I am trying to connect and bond with others. It’s a bit of an uneasy experience, tbh. But I like seeing the hope of connection they feel. I see it in their eyes, their smile. 

But there’s a trade-off: vulnerability. But I think with the correct amount of sustainability in mind, one can have meaningful connections with people, loved ones. 

I am being hopeful, yet again. Romanticism does things to people, my dear readers. 

But I think it’s hypocritically funny to be existentially hopeful. Perhaps, a mad man would. 

[Date]

To write is to feel. One simply cannot comprehend analogous signals for better comprehension and better understandability; one must digitize them. Now, the thing is how much on a fundamental level you digitize them. The more the bits, the more comprehensible. But the issue remains: a high sampling rate is possible but with a trade-off of latency. You need to observe first, experience first, analyse it, decode it, reconstruct it to feel, and end up needing more. 

[[Date]

She was buying okra, ladyfingers. Such a shallow name. I saw her fingers picking them up one by one. How she checks each one. Idk how she checks, but it’s quite interesting actually. I don't like their taste. She too. But she said “It’s easy to make them.”

I liked every time she whacked me. I wanted her to do it more. To hit me more. 

My readers, I could’ve watched her all day without being bored. 

I liked her messy hair today. 

[Date]

I saw a video. “Power of low kick.”

I tried to follow the steps. I hit my toes on a wall. I laughed. Looked if anyone saw. I returned to my room. I went out again to wash my hands, laughing.

[Date]

Tam vedyam purusham veda, yatha ma vo mrityu parivyatha

I always struggled with duality. There’s the one who experiences my life, the actor and there’s what I feel is something more real, the observer.  

My neural network interpretation has changed the way I perceive and approach life. Now it all has been just a game of weights and bias. 

So, it came kinda naturally although a bit bothersome but still. I just had to give weights according to contextual awareness and bias had been already modified by my genetics and my environment. 

I found a certain sense of familiarity; it may not be peace or something else. This familiarity soothes me. I never felt that much lonely, I felt alienated but I was able to connect with others. But to me they never could connect to a person like I am. I felt deformed. 

A hyperdimensional curve, across multiple dimensions. Every dimension resides, it resides in all.

I felt I live in all of them part by part. Upon integration it won’t be me but certainly a mutated me.

But that’s what will live on. Maybe it’s not will to belong; it’s about will to exist. Exist forever. It’s not about the actor anymore. It’s about the observer, the real one. The actual. The man. He cannot comprehend death. To an observer, the concept of death is absurd. What’s the purpose of the observer if there’s no way or mode of observation? It’s the observer’s ego. It wants someone to know them. To be known is to be immortal, and a truly model can only be done when it’s a safe space where the observer is being observed. That’s what ultimate bliss for the observer’s ego. To be seen. It’s poetic. It’s tragic. 

The observer’s will to comprehend, will to exist, starts cascading all. But the observer is seen as god, therefore, he hides. He hides his ego behind the actor’s play. 

But what of an observer who knows this too?

[Date]

How she flicks her hair. How she pouts. How she puts her pillow over her head. How our faces come closer towards her screen. How she shows her nails. Each of these little things.

Oh, horetio! To see someone so close, so feral, so real. Why would I need god? I have a feral feline, whose scratches mark me.  

It’s a delusion. But it’s mine.

[Note]

A man must will :

Destruction, Creation, sustainability 

Murderer.      Mad.        Man.

[Note]

To live without any guidance, a roof not physical but the one that you can collapse.

People have god, parents, love, delusions, a place somewhere to collapse. But I can’t. I’m undeserving of those delusions by choice. Yet I crave such delusions not less than anyone. Maybe more. I can’t collapse. I disfigure myself, me and him. 

Language isn’t enough to convey meaning. I seek meaning between the pauses. A continuous, latent meaning flow. 

If I wasn’t bottlenecked, I would use “are” with “I”. See it all flows simply now. I’m not alone. I have these “me”s like any normal person. But the stupidest or most intellectual thing I ever did was to recognise them. But they are all here.

How can one collapse into himself?

Isn’t it the absurdest thing?

My life has been a collection of questions. I can present them as bullet points and can answer relatively anything existentially. 

When will I stop living in these “?”s ?

My dear poet, say something to me, for I am illiterate.

[Note]

The continuous misalignment of my thought process against my parents has reached a position where neither of us could stand each other that much. 

I couldn’t stand their continuous need for external societal validation through relatives, neighbours, colleagues, everyone. 

Here’s an example of how it unfolds…my parents asked me to come over for their anniversary celebration. I, being the last few days of my college, hadn’t decided yet that I would even come.

Now if they’d told me that they want me there because it’s their anniversary, I would’ve reconsidered.

But they claimed that if I didn’t come, the guests will see this as something wrong or get a bad impression or image of me. If they think this is wrong, my parents would feel the same, hence I should come.

I tried to explain them. But what can you expect from someone who follows religion yet hasn’t read any actual scriptures properly? They watch YouTube shorts and Facebook videos of short-term motivation, misinterpreting scripture’s lines, also once I saw they were getting hyped up about an idol of “kali” crying. Such BS.

I recently found out their new way of coping with me. Declaring the one who argues is not respected, the one who speaks less is valued more. Again, the same external shit. And it felt like Nietzsche just pointed me out: look, this is the slave mentality I talked to you about in Genealogy of Morals. Changing the virtue so that they feel more valuable than the rest. Classic. I got so frustrated I asked, “Yes, I don’t have any value because I speak more, argue more. But you guys don’t. What have you achieved? What did you accomplish by speaking less?” 

I don’t judge things by their accomplishments, but the log must be as the dog is.

And with their gods and shit, I claimed yesterday if only you could measure, I am closer and connected to your actual gods than you guys ever could be. God is not out there. God is like a VPN operating over ourselves. It’s not true, but it protects one from harm’s way. I’ve seen it without a VPN. 

I also told them if they want good behaviour, they could just ask me to pretend, act. I can do it well too. But the feeble mind of commoners doesn’t know the value of the actor. They must present the acting as the truth. But those are separated. 

The act itself holds immense value even if it’s not truth. I know that too. 

I also asked if they had never heard of the phrase that says our life is an act and we are here to play our parts. They had heard it multiple times. They used that multiple times. Heck, I heard it from them the first time. Yet, their mind couldn’t comprehend.

By not understanding me, they eventually renounced themselves and their god too, the one thing that they needed more than anything to survive. 

And their constant try to villainise, diminish me has reached somewhere that it doesn’t bother me anymore. It does like a slow burn. 

Even if I say what I am saying actually aligns with the ones they worship, their scriptures. Be it Vedas, Geeta, Tagore’s or Vivekananda’s work. It doesn’t matter to them. They never read them, not even once. But they already know the conclusions, not like the Vedanta or Upanishads, rather the ones foretold by others. We shouldn’t eat beef, they scream, yet I haven’t found a single such source in Ved Geeta or any such high-level scriptures. Yes, it is seen, it is seen when the actual stories got highly dramatized. 

Only would’ve they read more.

I get their points. I have particularly created a separate vector for that kind of thought. I call it the sustainability vector. But it’s not everything. Sustainability is for the actor who performs . And sustainability vector is the script he’s supposed to follow through the play. But we are not given or handed our lines, our dialogues, our monologues, no, nothing, nada. 

Sustainability is a must that most philosophers, poets, and authors forget to add. But I know its immense value. But it is to be modulated, balanced. The observer, more fundamental and real, doesn’t require such feeble methods to function. Yet as we are tied to the mortal body of the actor, we mustn’t forget the importance of acting all while still  being connected to the real and fundamental one. The eternal man, god, is only realised through him. For god is nothing but a proxy of the eternal man. One mustn’t seek god outward, one mustn’t look for god, one must reject temples, mosques, churches, all holy places. “Hole’s place.” 

Tell me if it’s holy, then why there’s corruption, why even kids get molested, in some women aren’t allowed. Is this what god should be??

Holy place lies in us. The eternal man. My dear reader, do not confuse me with someone who is “Spiritual”. I do not prefer spirituality, it’s a sham. It comes from the debris of a failed religion. Understanding the duality, it’s psychological, philosophical, nothing more. It all boils down to the will to exist.

If I need to say a genealogy of misinterpretation that led us to despair, I must say it started with the will to exist. But it’s more fundamental and needs higher introspection than anything else. A closer replacement again, like a layer of abstraction, will to belong forms. Bow your readers remember they aren’t different, but like wave-particle duality, you can consider it like a manifestation of the same thing but seen through a different lens. Now, this will to belong is fierce and dangerous in its own way, but it still points towards the more gentle real side of ours that wants connection. But this too has become out of the commoner’s intellect. So we create another abstraction, will to power. Now, this is extremely dangerous. It’s needed. It has to be wielded. But not without accepting the god, the eternal man. 

But since the concept of god is corrupted, we don’t get any fruitful conclusions, rather decadence across decades and centuries. Just one mistake. Failing to see our will to exist. Recognising the holy within us.

[Note]

Certain types of Absurdity bring happiness. The absurdities that help us to break any system. One’s absurdity might be a system that inadvertently resists another system.

[Note]

To give shape to an unshakable abstraction is when it loses all its meaning.

“Nirakar”.

The observer or the supreme being doesn’t possess any shape. It might have, but being the observer, he is incapable of being watched, hence its form or shape is not of the question here. His supremeness lies in his absurdity and infiniteness. To give form to such vastness of a concept is nothing but the cruelest thing to do. It loses its vastness when it is given a form. He is therefore not to be worshipped, not to be formed, rather to be recognised within us. Not just within us, he being us. We are him. But fear not. The perception of him varies from person to person, no matter how slight it may seem. But it is not by design, rather shaped by norms, traditions, society, parents, all that diverge us from him, from self is here to blame.

But if one could make themselves aware enough, one rises to the level of interpretation that helps us to recognise and reach to become him. 

You know what’s more dangerous than those who diverge from him, the ones who give us false abstractions of him by giving him any kind of form.

Thus he gets corrupted. Thus us. Thus decadence.

[Note]

Amongst all the things I feel guilty about, the fact that I developed something more than just philia is troublesome. When she specifically asked not to. Yet, I didn’t, I couldn’t . You see there’s something about her, maybe how she flicks her hand, her messy hair even when greasy, I could just observe her forever. The question she asked me about what a guy feels when he fell in love. I couldn’t answer properly. In front of her I stumble in simple tasks, she engrosses every instrinct of mine. All I know is I could just observe her for all I care. She is something.  
I see her. I try to see her. To know her, to be known by her itself is bliss.

See, this delusion, this obsession is exactly the reason I fear what she might see in me. 

[Note]

The last few days aren’t enough. Only if I could experience all these slowly, patiently. 

No, I need her scratches.

[Note]

She smoked with me. 

I rest my case. 

The feeling of romanticism is actually of huge importance to me. I am experiencing all these like a teenager. Yes, a bit modulated but still the same delusions. 

I like her teeth, her fingertips.

I felt like I was being a creep watching her. But how one refrains from gazing at such a persona. Only if I could get enough days. 

This urgency for observance I’ve seen before. It’s beautiful. 

  

[Note]

We drank. We smoked.

I touched her delicate fingers not with lust but with guilt. If I could’ve hold her longer it would’ve felt like an eternirty. I left.

My dear reader if only one experiences such a woman. Her every act is flirt, a tease. Don’t worry, I know I’m projecting, this is but a delusion.

One I could submit to. I am being that delusional. 

This is how it happens, the observation, obsession. But what’s love but an active aesthetic obsession? 

If only we could’ve talked more. I want to know her more. How I observe her, how it makes me feel all of her is a blessing, a tease. I see now why men go to such lengths for their beloved. There’s these girls my readers, they contain chaos tamed by society, men could get destroyed by them but even then it is blissful enough, a delusion so grand. 

But I left.

[The inadverdant urge]

This is not a monologue. I need to talk to you, my reader. What a man does when someone asks them for their cherished ones. One simply must deny at all costs. One mustn’t follow my path. I could never have the sense of possession in me. And therefore, I couldn't have such a pure emotion. Therefore, I explained to him how to love even knowing his intentions. 

Was it my deliberacy of a coping mechanism towards something unattainable or was it she made me feel safe enough to let go of  male ego?

I couldn’t possess the purity one needs with possession.

Tell me,  A man, an aware one nonetheless how can ever have such pure of an emotion? The only answer is they can’t.

The only desire I possess is to observe and cherish her, each moment. And my readers, that is enough.

  

[Date]

I realized I don’t know how many tiles are there from the lift to our room. 212 or 210 or something else, I can’t recall properly. But I need to know how many tiles are there. 

People mark to tie them to certain places. I notice, keep, and ritualize. I don’t think I get nostalgic or miss like others. 

We get accustomed to the essence. Essence is how two systems interact. My nostalgia lies in between the incapability of the observance again. To see is the first step to actually feel. 

I’m more primal, unevolved. I got stuck at seeing. Feeling is for the evolved ones, not for an animal.

  

One Question remains. Will I write tomorrow? The next day? Maybe the day after. 

The brief encounter we had, it gave me hope. One day. 

I’ll write about her in mid sentences when my rationality fails, when I stumble, I am but a walking homunculus. Till then let me drink, smoke away life.

Today’s my birthday.

  

[Date]

She gave me a bookmark. Like I need to mark her chapter. I envied people who could possess. I always lament about the art of possession and how it’s irrational. But. See with her exclamation for each of my emotions there’s a ‘but’. I can’t but it is the one thing I’ll possess of her. A physical reminder. Like anyone I seek to possess her essence. I never did. But this my readers, a dire situation. Therefore, I must act to archive.

I wouldn’t need a bookmark to remember her by. But nonetheless it’ll hold the fabric of my delusion gently even if it frays slightly. 

She shared her earphone. We shared a few times before too. But this time was a bit different. Today, I also imagined us listening to the same songs under a tree. She leaned against me with a slow breeze making her hair fall over her face. 

Each song was already close to me but I could never put a face or person in those characters for someone for whom you could be that delusional. That’s what she gave me. A person.

I couldn’t watch her for long enough. She was ill. God’s divine conspiracy against his conspirator. She was cold. For that moment if only I had the permission to hold her I would’ve. But I don’t. And for the millionth time again I felt I could watch her for all I care. How she yawned when we were listening to ‘What a wonderful world’. My readers, This is absurd. absurdly beautiful, and I urge you to experience this at least for once. For without such delusion life itself is odd, bland, plain.

She was wearing an off -white kurti, ig. I ain’t good with colors. She came with her sister. Our college ended. We therefore must part. I don’t want to write this. This, an emotion of missing is highly unstable. 

But there were multiple times when we bid each other goodbye. And each time I thought I couldn’t see her again at least not today. But we did. And each time, I waited to see her go. All I wanted was her to turn around. This is me living a lie bollywood taught me, but a beautiful lie nonetheless. For the final time when my bus came, she was standing beside her car’s door. She looked beautiful.

On our farewell day, she asked me if I would write and share with someone else. But how one writes without inspiration!

  

[Note]

A romantic mustn’t just observe but ache with wonder.

[Note]

She looked beautiful— simply, utterly beautiful. Her green kurti. How her lips wore colour, as if stained by longing. How her tiny bindi urges me to hold her close even if just for a second. 

And her eyes, my dear readers they calm me, soothe me, seek me, destroy me, unravel me. They undo me, my nervous system. I am but a sensory obligation.

  

[Note]

We talked over meet. I had to keep shifting tabs just so she wouldn’t notice me noticing her. I’m a mess. She’s on the other hand like a pretty wildflower grown on a wall. The wall doesn’t go with her aesthetic but her own elevates the wall.  I could watch the wall if the flower blooms. And she is that. 

  

[Note]

She’s getting married, arranged. I have nothing in my power to divert the outcome. If only I knew about this I would’ve gotten a job meanwhile. I don’t know I’m lamenting at the chance of losing the person who once again made me realize I could love. 

I wish he try to understand her at least like I did more the merrier. 

If I knew I would’ve stayed that day. I didn’t know all of these would be that fast. I always knew my traumatized brain knew the chances of something like this to happen is high. The first person I loved cheated on me, second one got married and now she too. All of it were situational, if only I had enough money and power. I want to scream. It would’ve been better if I could with her.

My life has been nothing but a tragi-comedy. I laugh, cry, stop myself from feeling altogether all at once. I must retreat.

Those few days were bliss for me, and that’s not going to change. I loved her, I truly did, and I still do. I daydreamed about us, a lot. So many stories will be left unwritten. So does this. I had plans. 

  

After marriage, she’ll come here in my neighbourhood. And what will I do, ache? 

I’m, so is her, in an existentially orchestrated absurdity. Yet I’m too emotionally literate not to see the irony, but too human not to ache anyway.

  

But my heart blindly seeks suffering. 

  

[her]

  

We talked over call for four hours. I cried. I made her laugh. I finally confessed and she did too. 

She loves me.

What else a man needs!

[yes]

I’ll still write about her. Who cares! Ik she’s getting married but She looked beautiful in that saree,  the flower. Perfect. I am delusional perhaps. But yes, she looked perfect. One that I’ll ache forever to yearn. If only I could ..

I should stop. She is someone else’s. But who cares. I must admire her. 

She could've been my home. Therefore, I must yearn always even as someone distant who mustn’t have her. 

To have her is to collapse everything to meaning. And I’m absurd so the world is. 

I mustn’t. 

For her I'm an animal. I’m human, I’m everything. I exist between her teeth, her nails, her red lips, her eyes, in her bindi I exist. Not for anyone but me. I exist. 

She, perhaps one, who grounds my absurdity. I break, I shatter, I collapse to her, her everything. 

Words never were enough to express me. She might never know. I digress. She must. For her, I write. I muse, I wonder, I cry, I collapse. My dear readers, she made a grown man cry. What more I could experience. 

  

Yet, I must proclaim I feel hunger. Eternal, physical in every way possible, for her.

Perhaps, she’s too beautiful, too delicate to be mine. My chaos never 

Even when I’m drunk I keep thinking about her. Will she ever understand me? Doesn’t matter. 

I can reject love just to love her more in my own way.

  

Will she understand, I not only just love her but I love myself when I love her?

  

This feeling my dear readers, it’s heavenly. I love this, in every angle, every interpretation, . It doesn’t matter. Nothing else matters. Just this heavenly feeling. Men die for this, men go to war for this. She’s such, that. 

  

I want to see her. 

  

To everytime alex turner screams “but you’re not coming back again “ I must but feel a crisis. 

Yet, I know in my mind she never left. Delusion, perhaps I know, yet I keep, archive like an unending cryptic message. It’s not yours.Yet, you cannot but decode it perhaps by its beauty by the sheer nature of it, one cannot but must decode. I’m such for her. By design I must. 

For me she’s more than someone I would love. She’s someone I could collapse to. And I fear if no one else would, so I must. I digress. I want her to collapse to me. Out of mutual observence, a recognition to be seen without act.

  
  

She’s someone, one must keep in their dreams, prayers, confessions.

She associated my nerves’ each receptors. This place doesn’t remain just a place. Rather  memory inhibited morphed by her essence. She didn’t just existed like others. She became the poet of mine. She wrote me in ways she wouldn’t understand. She might though. She’s not like others. See the grand delusion of romantic fools. But in their own way they are right. And so am I. 

I always thought through every interaction we create version of our certain selves to each other. An image. Just an image that hides the intricacy in bullet points. She never was just an image to me. She was. I digress she is my poet, personal one. I need her to write me only. This is the possession I crave. Perhaps I too am materialistic to non materials.

For me, I never was a poet a writer never will be. I’m borrowing emotions, words all through her. She handed down the words the rhythm the meaning. Absurd isn’t it?

You’re my one true delusion.

For long I’ve missed my beloved, to whom I could relate every song to . For always it has been a noisy signal but I see her face now.

 To write about her, is itself an honor a bliss!
