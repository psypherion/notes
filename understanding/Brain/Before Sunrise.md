# Before Sunrise

O you, silent radiance!

How you press upon me, 

How you wound me with your fire.


Unspeakable, ungraspable

Yet nearer to me than my breath.

You linger beyond my reach,

as my voice falls silent

And still you shine upon me.


The night is vast, 

Its silence weighs upon me.

Yet, from within your glimmer stirs,

Like a flickering star.

Too far to grasp,

Yet too fierce to deny.


You are absence made radiant,

Presence made untouchable.

In you I learn to withhold myself,

To bow before the horizon,

That forever recedes.


To whisper yes into the abyss.

As your pilgrim.

Your silent witness.

A hymn to revere before the end.

A dawn that doesn’t break.

Yet you rise.

In your unending flare

I cry

Yes, unto eternity.
