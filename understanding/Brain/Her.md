# Her

My dear readers,

  

Forgive me for what I’m about to tell you, perhaps I shouldn’t. But a man, who never was loved must yearn like a miserable poet, like a blood thirsty mosquito’s cursed monotonous hymn sung at the sight of her mere existence. Worry not, for I always knew in my dysfunctional nerve I’m even undeserving of yearning. But, she grew roots of romanticism, love, yearning through my skin, blood, my dear old heart. Unlike most people who love, I can’t even remember the day I first saw her. Maybe it was the first day of our university. It might be. It must. Love at first sight was never for me. And so I didn’t love her the moment I saw her. I couldn’t. Perhaps, I should’ve. But how could an emotionally anaesthetized person ever have such a purest, rawest of an emotion!

  

The earliest memory I have of her is when she sunk her nails in my arms. She claimed “Women love strong muscles not the soft ones.” Unlike mine. It’s funny now. A tragi-comedy perhaps for both of us. At that time, I was busy making myself forget every ounce of emotions with drugs. I couldn’t notice her. Only if I could’ve, things might have been different. I spiralled more and more. Limbo perhaps. I wasn’t satisfied with the amount of drugs. I needed more and more. I always wished to scream at the top of my lungs till every vocal chord ruptures. But they never did, for I never screamed. I wanted to escape. From all the lies, my parents, all the persons’ who came into my life. I knew suicide was always an option. But I didn’t. I digress, I couldn’t. For I’m too mediocre for that, too meek, too decadent, too undeserving of death. But I was cowardly enough to indulge myself in drugs. I stayed at that sweet spot of ecstacy. You must think I’m wallowing in self pity. Yes, I am. The idea of anyone else feeling for me is too rich which is a luxury I could never afford. So, I feel just for me. A Narcissist, self indulged bastard. At that time I gave her “Notes from underground”. 

She never read it. Only would’ve she read, She would’ve understood the ache the spiralling in me. For I don't read books to escape rather to relate, understand and aestheticize my suffering. I knew Dostoevsky would’ve understood me. The conditional love I was brought up with smothered me into bits and pieces. So, the only way to survive that was to rebel and make the suffering aesthetically pleasing. She couldn’t rebel. She always adjusted even after being smothered by societal, parental pressure. I never knew back then. I never cared.

  

The reason I actually started noticing her is more weird. You see we men see women like objects, if she looks good enough she becomes exotic, an object nonetheless. So, loving a person becomes like hunting, setting traps so that one falls into. Not willingly. It's a morally gray area. No. Perhaps worse. One of my juniors asked me to make a connection with her. And I like any male I set traps. I devised how they would meet, talk. It’s shameful indeed. But as we started hanging out, I actually started noticing her. Beyond all the fluffs her cousin said. I saw someone really close to me. Someone who fears letting out but desperately wants to let out as if someone wants to be seen. You might be thinking this is a classic damsel in distress phenomenon as I interpreted it. But how can she have the privilege of being the only distressed one. For I am too. I saw her with all my interpretations. God! I saw her. I saw myself in her. You see, I might've been an excessive narcissist.

  

I still remember when she clawed at me again. She dug her nails deep in my arms and kept it there, I was being marked this time. Not just by her but by my interpretation of her. I felt I was being read. I felt seen for the very first time. As if, clawing is her way to reach something deep inside me that shattered my anesthesia. I caught a glimpse of her too. Not just her. The one with clawed nails that reaches down to your soul and holds a mirror. I could’ve just existed between the pause, between the moment she dug her nails and kept waiting for any reaction. But I always mimicked human behaviour, for I never got the grasp of human intricacies. I mimicked well enough to not be seen by others. But to her nails, I collapsed, my mask slipped, I stopped. I wanted to feel the nails. For a man like me, this is the most romantic thing one has ever done to me. I had been clawed by others but they never could reach me, they never could read me nonetheless write me. But she did. I crumbled.

  

We started hanging out more and more. Sometimes in excuse of working on her project, sometimes just to walk beside her under the evening lamps, when she said “I’m a hopeless romantic.” under the shadows the trees projected like holding us in their darkness forever. But amongst all I just wanted to be around her, know her more. It wasn’t just a “love” rather I couldn’t understand the emotions the experiences I was going through, and that made me more intrigued. Because, all these time I was trying to hold onto myself, a moderation, a chaos, I hold them all in. A bit too well. Maybe it’s a way for me to feel in control, a coping mechanism. And so was, intellectualizing my emotions, a coping mechanism too. I had a theory too. Like digitizing an analogue signal, to make it interpretable one can do the same approach. That’s when I decided I must write about her. She was indeed something different in a way I cant make you realize. You had to see her with the same lights, same air, same interpretations. I like to speak in ciphers. I told her about a story idea. The woman, I wanted to model as her. It was never about writing a story rather my process of digitizing my emotions avalanched by her. And I didn’t know why but I chose to let her in. Into my nerves, my eyes, my skin, my brain, even into my heart otherwise why would it beat differently when she’s with me. 

  

You see I always dreamt of leaving all my life behind to start over. Never for a second I thought twice about my parents. The house I grew up never quite felt like home to me. So, wasting my life for someone else even no matter how close they were, never made sense to me. I preferred my autonomy, my freedom over everything. I just wanted to escape from everyone’s expectation. From my family, friends even from my own self too. It was the only solution I could see. A quiet town, where no one would know me, even grocery shopping would be interesting. Without any expectation a mundane life becomes interesting enough. We were on the overbridge, in between it came up. She hesitated a bit, then she said, “I can’t leave my parents behind.” Even with thousands of issues, she couldn’t think of leaving the life behind, the one that was pre built for her. But unlike rest, she wants to, and to some extent she needs to leave all that behind. She didn’t stop she continued “I would go to norway. Less people, cold, icey weather…” I couldn’t deny that doesn’t sound like a perfect place. I added “the stars, the night sky, the northern lights, the mountains, I could just watch the sky all day…”

  

We talked about all the things her experiences with men, friends who eventually end up proposing her. Yikes! I’m no longer different from them. But at least not yet, I felt the inadvertent pull towards her.

  

Before all these, One day when I was in her room, she offered me a heart shaped biscuit. It was damped. I couldn’t eat it instead I broke it in half and gave them both to her. She remarked teasingly. On my way back, I knew she could also do this as something not teasing way, but I had the freedom to choose my interpretation. So, I chose. 

  

After this incident, She in a way lamented as a woman who never was loved properly. She wants to be persuaded, to be swayed, to be lifted from the ground. Something happened in me. The Amy Dunne, in me yelped. She was right. And at that moment I knew, I knew what to do. But before that I needed to ask her about something. If she had feelings for anyone else, and to me the closest person who tried was my junior. So, I asked about them. My junior told me a secret she told him not anyone else. So, given that context it was indeed a chance. But She denied any such possibilities of connection. So, now I could.

  

You see, where others might’ve considered her hopeless romantic as she does to herself, I think she is hopeful. More than I ever could be. The hopelessness lies in me. For me, hope was the hindrance, a lack of evidence to claim something true. There is my hope. In a house on a cliff –after an earthquake. Her eyes shine bright with hope, but I could sense something else.

There’s something, she harbours something, someone deep in her. She keeps her safe, locked away from the world. But I saw her. Within the light and night, between lamp posts and stolen glances, I saw her. She wants to be seen. It’s her. 

She fears to let her out. Tragedy! A great one.
