# Pursuit or Pavlov?

An intellectual degeneracy 

Students pursue bachelors masters phds

For what?

To gain more knowledge on the subject or 

Just to get a job and earn money

  

One must ask themselves.

  

If survival doesn’t become the sole reason to study, then only one learns.

  

But with abundance of capitalism and materialistic, individualistic mindset gaining knowledge, I digress. Pursuing academics has become nothing but a tool to establish a societal status and survive. So, it doesn’t matter how well do you grasp the concepts rather if you can puke down certain keywords properly you become well suited for society and survival. Even higher levels of education is also corrupted by such mentality and of course our society as a whole’s collective mindset. 

  

Students of reknowned universities, colleges too are victims of somewhat similar mentality. 

  

If wisdom doesn’t come from one’s learning, then their learning is wrong.

  

We all once learned the structure of the atom.

Little balls orbiting a nucleus like a mini solar system.

Cute, clean, cartoonish.

But only by pursuing physics further do we learn that truth was never so simple.

  

Now imagine—

A student who stops there,Fixates on Rutherford as gospel,Makes that image their religion.

  

Or worse—

  

A person who never studied physics

But knows E=mc² from posters and memes.

Their trust lies not in inquiry,

But in aesthetics, familiarity, and the clout of scientific branding.

  

Or worse still—

  

A student whose teacher learned from YouTube clips and infographics

Repeats shallow concepts with authority

  

Because they know how to _teach_ better than they know how to _think_.

  

If any of these scenarios bother you—even a little—

congratulations. There might still be hope.

  

Now replace “physics” with “religion.”

  

Most people with their mind wired as such, either never read a single piece of theistic scriptures other than the romanticised versions like a kid needing pictures, fantasy elements to read a book to hold onto their fragile concentration Or,  outsource understanding of god through instagram quotes, bumper stickers or, repeats other’s interpretations as their own ‘cause their feeble mind is not intellectual enough to go make their own interpretations… even if thousands of well thought interpretations are out there, people will still choose overly marketised beliefs over all because overly marketised version sells us a sacred sense of belonging.

  

People outsource the divine

to Instagram captions, WhatsApp forwards, bumper sticker metaphysics.

And somehow still claim to “understand God.”

They say, _“Belief is enough.”_

But belief without inquiry is just obedience.

No different than a dog salivating at a bell.

  

Hence even a research grad can claim to understand god, religion just belief is enough like the fox claiming the grapes our sour without tasting. But atleast such an unintelligible animal tried (in the story ofc) but I can’t say this for most people of our age.

  

It’s not difficult to read, learn, introspect. 

  

As I’m a Hindu by birth, I can point out a few great books : Geeta (not the ones interpreted by a capitalistic organisations rather one can as an example take Swami Vivekananda’s interpretations and absorb it in their own way and this come upto their own interpretation), Advaita Vedas, and for relatively modern understanding one can use religion of man by R.N Tagore etc.

  

Given, even though mentioning “Hindu” specifically doesn’t necessarily opts out people of other beliefs. 

  

One must, should try them all at least once.

  

The religious illiteracy is a huge reason for religious discomfort amongst others. 

  

And one must view theistic scriptures as that only not as history. If one is viewing theistic scriptures as history then one should look for archeological evidence, and timeline of the scriptures must match with natural history of earth.
