# Taking Back


It happened on a thursday night. Not Friday, not a drunken decision, not a drunken night. LIke thousand other long weekdays, when our office floor was half emptied, and the constant hum of a moderately broken air conditioner was the only witness. 

  

She leaned over my desk just enough so her scent her essence could fill my atmosphere enough, pointing at a document from an earlier meeting, her voice low, measured, a bit too measured. And I notice her, her palm braced against the table, close enough that if I moved my finger a inch, just an inch, I’d touch her. But, I shouldn't, so I didn’t. Not yet.

  

Then she said something. That reminded me of the days of what they could’ve been. I can’t recall. Maybe it was just her face, her voice, the way her glistened lips moved under the soft dim fluorescent light. 

  

I want to hold her, her fingers, her waist. This as an emotion is too complex, not for someone like me to understand.

  

I look for her eyes. Her eyes have changed. No longer she was the same person I knew, she evolved. Her eyes told me to lay bare my guards. Before I could wrestle my mind, she does it, just the faintest brush of her fingers over mine. A test.

  

It’s the quietest moment of my life, but inside, it’s deafening. Years of silence, all the words we didn’t say, all the glances we buried, everything is right here in that half-inch of contact.

I should pull back. I don’t. 

I grasped for her fingers like clawing to never let go. She didn’t flinch either. She stayed. Her lips moved. I stand. Not because I’ve decided to, but because something in me refuses to stay still any longer. And then she’s in my space, close enough that there’s no neutral ground left between us. The pull, the inevitability – this already has happened sometime, somewhere. But there were rules. I mustn’t have and she shouldn’t have.

When it finally breaks, it’s not gentle. It’s not careful. It’s desperate, messy, years late. 

It’s strange how quickly rules dissolve.

One second, the line between us is a wall of years, of choices, of promises to other people.  
The next, it’s paper, tearing under the smallest pressure.

Her hands find my collar first, not in a sudden grab, but in that searching way—like she’s trying to memorize the texture of my shirt, the warmth underneath, the proof that I’m here and real and still hers in some corner of the universe. I feel her fingers tremble—not from fear, but from the effort of holding back what she’s been swallowing for so long.

She tilts her head, her lips almost brushing mine, pausing there as if to ask if I’ll let her rewrite the world. My answer is the way my hands slide around her waist, pulling her in, feeling the taut curve of her back arch into me.

When she finally kisses me, it’s not delicate—it’s not a “first kiss” kind of kiss. It’s the kiss of someone who’s been dying of thirst and just found water. There’s a hunger in it that makes me dizzy. She’s not tentative; she’s claiming.

She doesn’t step into me so much as crash into me, her palms flat against my chest, pushing me back until the edge of the desk digs into my hips. I expect hesitation, a pause, some fragment of restraint — but she’s already slipping my jacket off my shoulders, letting it fall with a dead weight thud to the floor.

Her hands are everywhere — jaw, hair, chest — moving like she’s mapping territory, memorizing the ridges and lines, but also claiming them. My body is no longer mine; it’s her instrument now.

"You should have taken me then," she whispers against my lips, "but you’re taking me now."

And I do. Not gently, not in any way that belongs to patience or caution. We move like we’re making up for all the years we pretended to be fine without this, without each other.

The rest of the world doesn’t just fade—it ceases to exist.

When she pushes me into the chair, it’s not gentle. Her skirt slides as she straddles me, knees tightening against my thighs, pinning me in place. I can feel her weight, her control, the shift in gravity where she’s the one dictating the pace. Her blouse comes loose in her own hands, buttons slipping open like they’ve been waiting for this exact night to give up their grip.

I try to touch her waist, but she catches my wrists and pins them against the armrests. Her face is inches from mine, breath mingling with mine, eyes locked "You’ve always been in control," she says, low and dangerous, "Always the one to decide when enough is enough. You’re going to sit there and feel what it’s like when it’s not up to you."

Her hips press into me with a slow, grinding rhythm, and I can feel my body betraying every ounce of composure I thought I had. My breath quickens, my fingers twitch against her grip, but she doesn’t let go — not until she decides to.

When she finally releases my hands, it’s only because she wants them where she wants them — tangled in her hair, along her back, pulling her closer as her mouth crashes into mine again.

She moves with a kind of violence that isn’t about harm, but about reclamation — biting my lip just enough to taste blood, digging her nails into my shoulders through my shirt. Every sound she makes is a confession: the low moan when my palm slides up her thigh, the sharp inhale when I catch the nape of her neck between my teeth, the shudder when I murmur her name in that tone that only ever belonged to her.

The desk becomes collateral damage — papers shoved aside, a pen clattering to the floor, a coffee mug tipping and spilling. She pushes me back onto it, climbing over me, hair falling like a curtain around our faces.

"Look at me," she demands, and I do — because in this moment, she’s not the woman who was ever denied anything. She’s the author of the scene, the one writing me into the kind of surrender I never thought I’d allow.

When we finally break for air, it’s not because we’re done — it’s because the act has turned into something else entirely. This isn’t a single night’s indulgence. This is years of withheld hunger burning itself into muscle memory.

And I know — from the way she’s looking at me, chest heaving, lips swollen — that neither of us will ever go back.

The lock clicks behind us, and she doesn’t wait for ceremony.  
Her coat hits the floor before her shoes are even off.  
The space between the threshold and my living room becomes an unbroken stretch of hands pulling at fabric, mouths finding each other mid-step.  
It’s not frantic — not anymore.  
It’s precise.  
Like she’s had this mapped out in her head for years and is just following a plan she’s memorized.

She pushes me onto the couch and doesn’t sit beside me — she kneels in front, resting her palms on my knees.  
Her eyes rake over me with an intensity that makes my skin feel stripped without a single piece of clothing gone yet.  
When she does start unbuttoning my shirt, it’s slow — the kind of slow that makes your pulse go uneven.

“You always looked like you belonged in control,” she says, sliding the fabric off my shoulders. “I think I hated that.”

She doesn’t stand when she kisses me this time; she pulls me forward by the collar, taking her time, like every second is hers to spend.

She doesn’t let me turn on the lights.  
The dark is her ally tonight; it erases the outside world, leaves only sound, touch, breath.  
Piece by piece, she removes what she’s been told to keep on — each layer of fabric not just clothing, but a symbol of every compromise, every obedience.  
I don’t strip them from her. I watch her do it, because that’s what she wants: me seeing her on her own terms.

When she climbs over me, there’s no hesitation.  
Every movement is deliberate, claiming, rewriting the story of her body and who gets to touch it.  
I let her — because this is not mine to take. It’s hers to give.

The night doesn’t collapse into one fevered blur; it breaks into chapters.  
Moments on the floor. Against the wall. Her head on my chest in the half-light, fingers drawing circles on my skin while neither of us speaks.  
A slow burn, a quiet interlude, then a sudden flare that leaves us both gasping again.

By the time sleep takes us — if it can be called sleep — it’s the kind where bodies stay tangled, because separation feels like betrayal.

I wake to the sound of a kettle boiling.  
For a moment, I think I’m alone — the bed still warm, but the weight beside me gone.  
Then I hear her bare feet against the wooden floor, unhurried, and I know she’s not slipping away.

When she comes back, she’s wearing my shirt. It hangs unevenly on her frame, one button fastened wrong, and she’s holding two mugs.  
She sets mine down on the bedside table without asking if I want it.  
Of course I do.

She sits cross-legged at the foot of the bed, sipping hers, watching me.  
Not the casual watching of a lover admiring the morning light — no, this is the measured, assessing gaze of someone cataloguing exactly how you look when you’re still half-dreaming.

“Do you always sleep like that?” she asks.  
I blink. “Like what?”  
“Like you’re expecting to be woken up for something important.”  
Her tone makes it impossible to tell if she’s teasing or just… noticing.

We drink in silence for a while.  
She doesn’t reach for me. Doesn’t lean in.  
Instead, she lets the air stretch between us until it’s almost unbearable, and then — without warning — she smiles.  
It’s not sweet.  
It’s the kind of smile that says: I know exactly how much space I take up in your head now, and I intend to keep it.

When she finally speaks again, it’s soft, but there’s an edge to it.  
“This… doesn’t end here.”  
It’s not a question. Not even a statement to be debated.  
She’s simply informing me of the terms, the same way someone might remind you that the tide comes in whether you’re ready or not.

She stands, leaves her empty mug on the dresser, and walks toward the bathroom without looking back.
