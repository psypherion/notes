# To Die

## Preface 

What I'm about to write isn’t for the content, complacent souls rather the outcasts,   those who dare to question every higher authority, even themselves. It is for those who choose the brutal, uncompromising truth over the sugar-coated lies and false peace that society pedals as a coping mechanism for an unforgiving, uncomforting universe.

  
One must still have chaos in oneself to give birth to a dancing star.

-Friedrich Nietzsche

Within the depths of our disordered, raw existence, there lies a hidden brilliance waiting to emerge. Consider the ancient duality embodied by Shiva and Vishnu—gods of destruction and creation. They are not opposites, but two faces of the same cosmic coin, each necessary for the endless cycle of ruin and rebirth that underpins all that is. This manifesto is a call to those who refuse to settle for a life of undisturbed ease and empty certainties.

Think Think … Practice Thinking.

-Hritwik Ghatak


I write not to console, but to confront; not to offer solace, but to provoke thought. In the uncomfortable space between despair and defiance, the raw truth reveals itself—a truth that compels us to break the chains of conformity and embrace the agonizing beauty of an examined life. Let these pages be a refuge for those weary of the shallow peace modern society offers—a rallying cry for those brave enough to challenge everything, even if it means standing alone in the storm of their own convictions.

### Init

#### Whyyy?

One thing that has always troubled me is that most people lack a valid, inherent reason to live for the next day. In my observations, the typical responses fall into two categories: one, the notion that they must live on just not to cause distress to their loved ones; and two, the desire to indulge in materialistic luxuries. Yet, both of these answers are outsourced—they rely on external factors rather than stemming from an internal, self-determined purpose. This realization raises a critical question: if our reasons for living are merely reflections of societal or material expectations, what then is the true, intrinsic motivation that should drive us?

The incessant need to derive purpose from the opinions, expectations, and comforts provided by others—is nothing more than a convenient delusion. This reliance on external markers of value is a betrayal of the self, a surrender of one’s inner voice to a chorus of empty echoes.

#### Inadequacy of External Validation

The problem is not that these external validations provide momentary solace—they do, and they can even offer a fleeting sense of security. The problem lies in their inherent inadequacy. They are, by nature, transient and shallow, incapable of withstanding the relentless scrutiny of a life that demands more than a manufactured narrative. 

What good is a life if its purpose is nothing but the echo of another’s expectation?

  

For what is a man

What has he got?

If not himself then he has not

To say the things

He truly feels 

And not the words

Of one who kneels

                                          – My way : Paul Anka 

I have seen firsthand the corrosive effects of living solely for external validation. It leads to a quiet despair—a slow, insidious erosion of the inner self. The constant need to please others or to chase the next material indulgence leaves no room for the inner voice that dares to question, to challenge, and to seek the unvarnished truth. It is a compromise, a betrayal of the raw potential that lies dormant within each of us.

True purpose cannot be borrowed or imposed; it must be discovered through a brutal, honest confrontation with our innermost being. It is not enough to exist merely to satisfy the expectations of those around us. To live authentically, one must reject the superficial comforts of external validation and instead embark on the arduous journey of self-examination. Only by tearing down the facades built by societal expectations can we hope to uncover the intrinsic drive that, when nurtured, has the power to transform our very existence.

#### Cost of Accepting Shallow Answers

Religion has offered an easy escape by invoking a higher power—a comforting blanket that masks the brutal, often lonely quest for meaning. While these sacred doctrines can serve as the bedrock of a peaceful, stable existence for many, their solace is a double-edged sword. Over time, the clarity with which they once provided purpose tends to erode into corruption and complacency. 

I am not here to denounce the solace that religious beliefs can provide; I acknowledge that for many, they are the bedrock of a peaceful, stable existence. But for those of us who dare to question, who refuse to accept shallow answers, the search for an intrinsic, self-determined reason to live becomes not just an intellectual exercise but a necessary, if painful, journey.

Yet, the cost of accepting these shallow answers is immense.  Relying on delusional claims that one is part of a predetermined divine order can lead to passivity—a surrender of individual initiative in favor of waiting for external redemption or  focusing on fulfilling religious obligations to avoid punishment or secure reward may cause some to prioritize adherence to ritual over the cultivation of personal understanding, which over time can erode the ability to think beyond the boundaries set by tradition or focusing on communal commandments and external observance, there can be a risk of reducing complex personal experiences to a checklist of obligations. This surrender is not a mere compromise; it is an abdication of the self. When we cling to such superficial purposes, we slowly erode the very essence of our being, leaving behind an echo of what might have been a life forged in truth and struggle.

[Here I must insert eastern philosophical views such as santana, buddhism provides a completely different way, possibly a far better way which I’ll discuss later, isn’t without a few nuisance mostly due to lack of development of current science at that period.]

  
  

## Chapter 2 :

### Conformity weds Capitalism 

#### Religion as a source of Conformity 

From an early age, individuals are taught to align their beliefs, practices, and even personal identities with the tenets of their faith. The result is a deeply ingrained adherence to a collective worldview—one that values tradition and uniformity over individual reinterpretation or innovation. As religious doctrines are passed down through generations, they solidify into a cultural norm, creating an environment where questioning these established norms is not just discouraged, but often met with resistance from the broader community.

Over time, the authority of these doctrines can become unchallenged, and the practices derived from them rigid. What begins as a means to provide moral guidance and community cohesion gradually transforms into a mechanism for social control, reinforcing a particular way of living that emphasizes conformity over personal authenticity. The unquestioning acceptance of religious norms becomes a template for conformity, setting the stage for a society where deviation is minimized, and the status quo is maintained. This ingrained tendency toward conformity then extends its reach into other spheres of life, reinforcing structures in which individuality is subdued in favor of communal and, eventually, commercial uniformity.

  

#### Economic roots as an extension to religious work

From a young age, individuals are socialized to embrace a market-driven worldview that values efficiency, predictability, and uniformity. This conditioning echoes the early religious teachings that stress adherence to established doctrines. Schools, families, and communities are nothing more than economic boot camps, molding us to measure success by how well we fit the mold. This is why parents and educators push for careers in engineering or medicine, not out of genuine passion, but simply because these paths promise cold, hard financial security.

The economic roots of conformity don’t just mimic the religious framework—they amplify it. Both systems, one preaching a sacred order and the other a ruthless market logic, weave a social fabric that prizes stability and punishes any hint of deviation. In this dual conditioning, individuality is crushed, leaving us to churn out predictable lives that feed a system designed to keep us in line.

  

#### Conformity breeding Consumerism

In a society where deviation is shunned, the masses are fed a steady diet of uniformity—packaged lifestyles and mass-produced dreams sold as the keys to fulfillment. The same forces that stifle independent thought in our homes and schools now push us toward a relentless chase for the next commodity, the next trend, the next temporary high.

We’re conditioned to crave what’s advertised: sleek gadgets, trendy clothes, sanitized experiences that promise satisfaction but deliver only fleeting pleasure. It’s not about genuine need or self-expression; it’s about fitting into a preordained mold. The more we conform, the easier it is for the market to control us. Our individuality is replaced by a hunger for the latest must-have—a reflection not of who we are, but of what we’re told to be.

This cycle of conformity and consumption doesn’t just fill our shelves; it fills our lives with emptiness. Consumerism becomes a crutch, a way to mask the lack of real, self-determined purpose. We end up spending our days chasing products and trends, all while our true selves wither away, stifled by the weight of manufactured expectations.

  

#### BOOM! Capitalism

When people think alike, act alike, and desire the same things, the market has them exactly where it wants them. There’s no need for force; people willingly buy into the system because they’ve been conditioned to. The transition from religious and societal conformity to economic conformity is seamless—one feeds directly into the other.

Everything becomes a product. Identity, experiences, even rebellion itself is packaged and sold back to us. The system doesn’t care about individuality; it only cares about what can be monetized. The more predictable people are, the easier they are to market to, and capitalism thrives on that predictability.

Consumerism isn’t just a byproduct of capitalism—it’s its backbone. The cycle of work, earn, spend, repeat is designed to keep people chasing, never questioning. The machine runs smoothly as long as no one steps out of line. And stepping out of line isn’t just discouraged—it’s expensive, inconvenient, and exhausting. So, most don’t bother. They keep moving, keep consuming, keep fueling the system that keeps them in place.

  

#### Promise

Capitalism offers a promise—a neat vision of success and happiness that convinces us if we just work hard and keep buying the right things, everything will fall into place. But in reality, this promise is rarely fulfilled. It’s a promise that sells hope with slick marketing and polished ads, while delivering little more than a cycle of endless consumption. The vision of a better tomorrow is used to keep us moving in predictable patterns, chasing temporary satisfaction rather than questioning the system. In this way, the promise reinforces conformity by encouraging us to trade in our unique needs and aspirations for a standard, market-approved identity.

  

#### Identity at play

Under the pressure of conformity and the drive of capitalism, personal identity is no longer a fluid, evolving aspect of who we are—it becomes something to be packaged, marketed, and sold. In this system, our individuality is shaped and often dictated by external forces rather than emerging from an authentic inner process. What we come to see as our “self” is frequently a carefully curated product, assembled from the fragments of societal expectations and mass-market narratives.

From the way we dress to the careers we pursue, our identities are constantly influenced by the images and messages that the market offers. The true, nuanced self is often replaced by a standardized persona—one that fits neatly into the boxes defined by both economic and cultural forces.

This commodification of identity reduces complex human experiences to trends and slogans, leaving little room for genuine self-discovery or rebellion against the status quo. In a culture where every facet of our being can be bought and sold, the art of being truly individual becomes a radical act.

  

#### Paradox : growth v/s individuality 

The promise of growth—be it economic, technological, or social—is hailed as the ultimate progress. Yet, in the relentless chase for expansion and profit, individuality gets sacrificed. The more we prioritize relentless growth, the more we lose sight of what makes us unique. Schools and Univ, to produce measurable results, often streamline curricula and enforce standardized testing. In doing so, they favor those who excel within a narrow set of metrics, leaving little room for creativity or divergent thinking. Students, molded by these systems, risk becoming interchangeable products, their unique talents and critical faculties sacrificed for the sake of uniformity and quantifiable achievement.

Ultimately, the drive for growth feeds a cycle where conformity is rewarded and personal divergence is seen as a liability. It’s a bitter irony: the system that promises to elevate us also confines us, turning our unique potential into just another line on a balance sheet.

  

#### Self commodification 

In a world where every aspect of our lives is measured, packaged, and sold, even our very identities become commodities. We start to see ourselves not as complex, evolving beings but as products to be optimized for market value. From the way we present ourselves on social media to the career paths we choose, our self-worth is increasingly tied to external ratings and performances.

Self-commodification is the final step in the chain of conformity, where the quest for acceptance transforms personal identity into a product. It’s a harsh reality: the more we tailor ourselves to meet the expectations of a consumer-driven society, the further we drift from the authentic, unfiltered self that once held the power to truly innovate and challenge the status quo.
