# Selection of Memories by Hippocampal ripples

**Selection of Memories by Hippocampal ripples**

: How hippocampus tags specific memories for later Consolidation during sleep

![[hippocampus.png]]

Hippocampus : 
Hippocampus plays a vital part in conversion of short-term memories into long-term memories, a process known as memory 

consolidation.

  

Memory formation, Consolidation, Retrieval.

  

also crucial for -> spatial navigation, planning.

  

Essential for learning and cognitive function. It helps us remember important 

events, experiences, and information that we can later retrieve and use to make decisions or 

solve problems. The ability to form and retain memories is fundamental to our ability to 

navigate the world around us, learn from past experiences, and make sense of new information.

  

  

  

Episodic Memory -> ability to remember personal experiences as sequence of events in temporal sequence

  

switches between wakefullness and sleep state

  

wakefulness :

1. records experience
2. where things happens and in what order
3. tracks events in cognitive map by creating an internal model of the environment

  

Sleep : 

1. Hippocampus replays experiences recorded during the day
2. replay events are characterized by a specific electrical activity -> Sharp Wave ripple

  

IN awaken state replayed memories are tagged for consolidation

  

local synaptic plasticity

  

  

Pyramidal Neurons | Inhibitory interneurons

————————————————————————

  

During sleep while replaying events a massive wave of synchrinized i/p generated from hippocampus’s a part (say)

  

Now this surge is prevented by inhibitory interneurons by supressing other active neurons.  
  
Now this excitation and inhibition creates the high frequency ripple

  

Population activity is constrained by the connection b/n neurons. 

  

Manifold encodes leqarning progression too  
1. Awake replays bookmarks

2. Sleep replays consolidatis

  

for a rat’s brain it has 400 neurons and for a human its almost 86 million neurons.  so all the i/p data recieved must lie between a hyper dimensional manifold co structed by the neurons. Now as seen in the study we dont need all the higher dimensions rather we can compact the size by first categorizing the differences in the higher dimensional plane then reducing thr manifold for lower dimension.
